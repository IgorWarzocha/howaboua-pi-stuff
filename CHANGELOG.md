# Changelog

## 0.0.1

Initial monorepo release for the Howaboua Pi package collection.

This repository brings the previously separate Pi packages into one Bun workspace while keeping every package separately installable. It also adds aggregate packages for installing everything, extensions only, or skills only:

- `@howaboua/pi-stuff`
- `@howaboua/pi-extensions`
- `@howaboua/pi-skills`

Legacy Pi Codex history remains in its [package changelog](./packages/pi-codex-conversion/CHANGELOG.md).

Going forward, package-level changelogs remain the source of truth for each package, and this top-level changelog summarizes monorepo-wide releases.

[Full changelog](./packages/pi-better-skills-tool/CHANGELOG.md)

- Browser operations tolerate unused `response_length` hints. Page-length controls for `open` and `find` are unchanged.

### @howaboua/pi-cache-hit-predictor — 0.0.1

### Changes

- [#140](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/140) [`c95d68a`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/c95d68a21939860e4c6dcff9c58a6bf8a50044ff) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)!:
  - Show inline cache-hit predictions when switching models or reasoning lanes.
  - Warn once that automatic reasoning changes can miss the prompt cache and affect costs or quotas.

[Full changelog](./packages/pi-cache-hit-predictor/CHANGELOG.md)

### @howaboua/pi-codex-conversion — 3.0.47

- Explain when legacy OpenAI Codex login is required instead of Sign in with ChatGPT, with actionable login renewal guidance for voice failures. PCC also clarifies Remote context requirements and Sites authentication failures.

- Fixed HTTP 400 errors when using Local or Tree history with Pi's OpenAI ChatGPT sign-in.

  Show only the latest Notes saved notice on the active branch while preserving earlier checkpoints in session history.

- Preserve supported reasoning levels when context-history tools are enabled, preventing unsupported "none" errors when cycling GPT-6 Sol or Luna.

  Clarified that Auto reasoning supports GPT-6.1 Sol in its settings description.

  Updated `change_reasoning` guidance to call before beginning work and reassess when difficulty or uncertainty changes.

- Idle window rollover now requires fresh notes from the latest completed turn. Without fresh notes, the incoming prompt runs normally instead of triggering a checkpoint request.

[Full changelog](./packages/pi-codex-conversion/CHANGELOG.md)

### @howaboua/pi-codex-guardian — 0.0.1

- Initial release of Codex Guardian approval reviews for Pi.

  - Select exact tools and optional argument regexes for AI review or local blocking in native Pi, Code Mode and Notebook Mode. Global and trusted project rules combine. No rules are configured by default.
  - AI reviews use the active ChatGPT-backed Codex session. Denials and review failures block execution. Local blocking needs no model request.
  - Use `/guardian` to inspect status, enable or disable protection, and reload rules.

  Installed separately from the extension bundles. Review requests are not confirmed to be free.

[Full changelog](./packages/pi-codex-guardian/CHANGELOG.md)

### @howaboua/pi-codex-imagegen — 0.0.10
